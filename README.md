# Data Visualizations

I am not finished, just turned in what I have done so far.  I had a lot of blockers and it was slow going.
- Data Visualization 1:
    - [Chart 1](titanic-bar/index.html) Passengers in each class
    - [Chart 2](titanic-bar/index-2.html) survived/died in each class
    - [Chart 3](titanic-hierarchy/index.html) Circle pack of passengers in each class

- Data Visualization 2:
    - see [Budget Jars](https://github.com/paloma-vm/budget-jars-responsive/blob/main/index.html) svg of Jars

- Data Visualization 3:
    - [Heatmap](heatmap/index.html) 
    - A heatmap of time spent on each task in Term 3
    - Uses my own data gathered with a Timeflip2 activity tracker
