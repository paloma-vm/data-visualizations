# Data Visualizations

I am not finished, just turned in what I have done so far.  I had a lot of blockers and it was slow going.
Data Visualization 1:
    [Chart 1](titanic-bar/index.html) Passengers in each class
    [Chart 2](titanic-bar/index-2.html) survived/died in each class
    [Chart 3](titanic-hierarchy/index.html) Circle pack of passengers in each class
